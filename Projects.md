# Listing of Open Source Projects Which Are Related to Annotify

We are commitizens for other projects ... that means that are not necessarily interested in leading the parade there, but we intend to follow it, fork a repo and look at the code, pay attention to what the issues are, cheer for it where we get an opporunity, critique it when we see something questionable, throw our two cents in and comment upon general direction and hopefully maybe we get to roll up our sleeves, not just to *fill sandbags* but to actually advance the cause of other projects.

There are far too many topics to list which tie in to Annotify.ORG, but our aim is to have roughly 125 project tangencies in the *hopper* of relationships that we need to pay attention to, to have 25 that we work on at least once a month, to have five that we touch once a week and to have ONE main project tangency that we are focusing on TODAY ... 

1) There is a lot of research being done in the *not all that secret* [***neuro-secret-sauce, the main ingredient of AnnotifyApp***](https://annotifyapp.github.io/template/2022/05/01/optimized-neuroadvantage.html). Our interest in annotification and notification is all about managing the complexity from all of engineering and scientific interactions that have to happen in order for us to take our level of engineering to the ecosystem, planetary and cosmological level. In order to level up system engineering by orders of magnitude like this, we have to do a much better job at optimizing human neurological function and that extends to the optimization of emotions, moods and thorny interpersonal differences ... *playing well together* is a matter of neuro-optimization and meditative thoughtfulness, ie to predictably *get along* with team members as if EACH workweek were the greatest seminar with a yogi in mountains of Tibet ever attended by mortals.

2) Project Jupyter / Colab / Kaggle / JetBrains and a host of other platforms for collaboratively working on Jupyter notebooks ... this kind of information technology, including everything that it is built upon, including the K8s orchestration and Docker containers on different compute platforms in the cloud is sort of the CORE foundation of what Annotify is about ... and none of that stuff is static; it is continually evolving and getting a lot more reliable and predictable and just generally capable of greater things ... especially as the communities around these things also gain in competency and experience of make these things works in communities.

3) *In-browser development workstations* ***WITH AI/MLops PLUG-INS*** ... yes, that, of course, means Chromium [including all of the flaws and ongoing improvements of Chromium by the Chromium development community]... for the completely uninitatted that, a gentle introduction is the *mature-feeling* but still evolving product [VSCode.dev OR VSCode in the browser](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev), with no need for setting up the environment or anything like a crosstini Linux container *which was still seemed like a big deal just a year ago.* But, Microsoft is primarily a greated adopter of what works ... so we should really give credit ORIGINAL inspiration of Annotify to the work of [GitPod.io on Github](https://github.com/gitpod-io) and [The GitPod developer community](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/contribute). It's an evolving landscape, so that means we will always be behind, but trying to adhere to the de facto standards in these sorts of browser-based codespaces which, for the time-being at least, mean [GitPod Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/gitpod-io/projects/27/views/1) ... but, of course, there will be developments in the [GitHub *Codespaces* topic](https://github.com/topics/github-codespaces) which also influence the directions of these things. 

4) GitHub / GitLab and especially their communities of users ... along with the virtual confs/presenters ... there are enormous things to learn about these two ecosystems in their CURRENT reincarnations ... in fact, having the whole set of Git-host that we have available today is such incredible luxury; the Git realm certainly does not stop GitHub and GitLab; the Git development list is still important to follow  ... maybe even more informative to look at the differences between these two platforms in the last decade ... not just studying the personalities involved, but why did the ideas work with customers and how solid are those customer relationships and commitments. For example, why did GitHub mgmt even pursue an acquistion if the company was such an AWESOME force to be reckoned with and had such a bright future -- what does Microsoft bring to the table, ie why didn't Microsoft wreck it?  You might claim that some customers left Github when Microsoft acquired GitHub, but is that really true, ie GitLab was already doing reasonably well before the entry of Microsoft ... why GitLab get ANY traction or sustaining oxygen [from any of its initial large paying customers] when GitHub [with Heroku] was already such dominant force in Git hosting? It would appear that there is something to be said for ***second-mover advantage,*** ie, using things like the better talent pool of a remote-first workforce [to use those who could not work at GH-HQ] and reaching out to that Git-host-user who wanted *something better* than what the GH mgmt team had decided was sufficient.

5) Most [startup accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_accelerator) are government-funded economic development *efforts* which are not really legit efforts, thus are almost necessarily gauranteed to produce failures, ie actually can be studied as examples of what not to do ... but some of the private ones, [YCombinator and HackerNews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator), [VentureHacks and ProductHunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngelList), [TechStars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techstars) do have decidely better odds ... not just because they get the cream of cream of the cream of the worldwide crop of entrepreneurs -- they also have better methods [and powerful mafia connections] ... there are new, innovative ideas like MicroAcquire [and BuildSell30] which leverage the notion of [hackathons, code sprints, datathons, codefests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) for the startup realm .... so the innovation in the startup accelerator realm is far from dead ... we generally like the idea of trotting a new nanoentprise idea out in public, like an old-school Toastmasters club, and seeing where the idea goes ... it should be easier to fail and survive failure ... it's 2022 -- there's no good reason why any new concept should burn through even a $1000/week before the idea starts getting some traction to bootstrap its existence.

6) SnakeMake and [Arxiv Labs](https://labs.arxiv.org/),ConnectedPapers and the whole realm of things affiliated to pre-print Archives

7) [CDNjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/) the business ... as well as [the CDNjs GitHub repositories](https://github.com/cdnjs) and [VUEjs](https://github.com/vuejs) the [architecture behind progressive web apps (PWAs)](https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-progressive-web-app-architectures) including things like [the GitHub repos](https://github.com/jamstack) driving [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/)

8) The [Anaconda Community](https://community.anaconda.cloud/) has a substantial impact on how we view reliable foundations, which just work ... this particularly pertains to something like the basic [Conda infrastructure](https://github.com/annotifyapp/conda) OS-agnostic, system-level binary package manager and ecosystem -- it is perhaps not perfect, but it is used because it is just flat out more reliable and requires less arcane hackery to support

9) Truly OPEN machine learning, deep learning and open AI ... because of OpenAI GPT-4? Meh, not exactly ... more open ... we'll see how the world of closed proprietary open AI goes ... maybe it will work. We do respect the connections and hype of thing like Google DeepMind or OpenAI or anyone that can hire the best of the best in terms of evangelists and armies of PR mafia ... we're not being critical -- the level of networking and connection maintenance necessary to drive the hype surrounding something like GPT-4 is basically unparalleled in human history ... we study and admire proprietary companies for their approach to networking, not necessarily the AI itself ... although, their AI itself is not at all bad either. It's just that all AI practioners really need to *wise up* and understand how much of role HYPE and emotion plays in the world of human beings ... who work on and invest in AI.

10) Newsblur and the ecosystem of other approaches to RSS newsfeed readers ... particularly those with AI/ML sifting

11) AWESOME repositories and curated collections ... and the process of curated, annotated listification

12) If [Doublind](https://twitter.com/blinddou?lang=en) were only open source AND Git-based or sitting atop a standard Git DVCS with forkable repositories, we would contribute to that project ... we really, really like the [Doublind ideas](https://twitter.com/blinddou?lang=en) ... that's generally the gist of where we see research going ... our specific intention is more open source in nature -- we want to develop or contribute a community ... specifically a community that is developing social peer-review DECENTRALIZED or git-based repository [or organization of repositories] that would be forkable like the AWESOME repositories ... our goal is to exploit Github functionality [by adding code if necessary, but ideally contributing to the GitHub functionality] that would facilitate the process of reviewers making private annotations [for only their own use] before commiting a public review comment under a formal, authenticated peer-review process, upvoting papers [after being formally id'd and authenticated, so there's no ballot box stuffing or even stuffing by personna accounts] and notifying the paper authors and other reviewers of the paper. In other words, "blind" does not and cannot really equal annonymous, alt-personnas or devalued muliplier accounts ... but some approach to AUTHENTICATED social peer-review is the objective.
